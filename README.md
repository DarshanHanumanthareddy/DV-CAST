# DV-CAST
A distributed vehicular broadcast protocol for vehicular AD-HOC networks

Simulation of an advanced DV-Cast VANET in omnet++ using SUMO and VEINS. The advancement is in the primarily in using dynamic programming for broadcast supression as well as the use of trignometric calculus for neighborhood table construction.

## Dependencies
[Sumo 0.25](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sumo/?source=directory)

[Omnet++ 5.0](https://omnetpp.org/)

[Veins 4.4](http://veins.car2x.org/tutorial/)

## Quick Start

1. Download and setup SUMO,OMNET++ AND VEINS
2. Open Omnet++
3. Import and Compile Veins
4. Import and Compile dvcast
5. Choose a map through the sanfransisco.sumo.cfg and sanfransisco.launchd.xml files
6. Configure playground size through omnetpp.ini file
7. Run and enjoy!
